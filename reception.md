    <h1>Reception Details</h1>
    <p><strong>Address:</strong> Smallacres, Brownhill Road, BH25 5TT</p>

      <p>We would prefer if guests could share cars or take taxis to the reception if possible. The location is quite remote, and although there is parking available, you might get blocked in. Don't worry, thoughâ€”there will be plenty of time between the ceremony and the reception for you to go to your hotel, freshen up, and arrange transportation!</p>

    <p><strong>Reception Begins:</strong> 16:00 PM</p>
