# Wedding Website

This repository hosts our wedding website, built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and based on the [Beautiful Jekyll](http://beautifuljekyll.com/) theme.

## About This Project

We decided to create our wedding website on GitHub Pages because it’s a free, open-source platform that allows us to share our special day with family and friends in a personalised and creative way. By using GitHub, we also make it easy for others to view the code, learn from it, or even fork it to create their own wedding websites.

### Why Beautiful Jekyll?

Beautiful Jekyll is a popular Jekyll theme that offers a clean, modern design and is highly customisable. It’s an excellent choice for building websites with minimal effort while still providing a lot of flexibility for personalisation. You can find out more about Beautiful Jekyll [here](http://beautifuljekyll.com/).
